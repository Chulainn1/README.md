# Intro to Networking

A `(Computer) Network` is when two or more computers are connected and can communicate with each other.

The internet is inded a network, but a network is not the internet. Networking makes the internet possible.
* The internetis the world's largest and best known network. 

## Intro to TCP
`TCP` stands for Transmission Control Protocol, and provides a standard that allows machines to speak to each other.
TCP based communication allows two machines to establish an open channel for two-way data communication.

Computer networks allow computers/devices to send messages to each other. These operations take time, even more time than a computer takes to write to its own disk, for example.

TCP is a specific type of protocol (aka guideline, standard, agreement) which is commonly used to structure the data and workflow of data over the network.

LAN - local area network

NIC - network interface card
